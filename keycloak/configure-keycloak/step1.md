Let's configure our Keycloak Server by creating a new Realm, a role and an user.

## Login to the Keycloak Admin Console

To access the Keycloak Web Console follow this link: https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-8443-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/

On the landing page, click on **Administration Console**. This will bring you to a login form. Enter the following credentials : `admin` / `admin`.

You are now on the `Master` realm configuration page but let's create our own realm. 

At the top of the left menu, hover over `Master` and a button to add a new Realm will appear, click it.
Give it a name, for instance `katacoda` and click `create`, congratulations you have created your first realm !
