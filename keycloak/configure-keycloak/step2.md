Now we need to create a realm role, on the left menu click on `Roles`, this will bring you to a list of existing roles.
On the upper right of the table you should see a button `Add Role`, click it.

Give the Role a name, for instance `user` and save it, congratulations you have added a new Role to your Realm !
