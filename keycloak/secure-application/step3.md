## Your tokens 

Now that you are logged in, you can do the following :
* See your ID token, Access Token and Refresh Token
* See your Access Token in Base64 format, this format will be used to send secure requests
* Call a secured backend service


## Call Secure Service

Open the `Service Calls` menu and click the `Service Call` button. This will call a secured backend service (the same that we created in the previous scenario).
You should obtain a result `Service Call Result: {"message":"secured"}`.
